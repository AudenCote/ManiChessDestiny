Goal of game:
  -Have the most property (railroads, cities, and players) on the board by the end of the game. The only players that may be added
  to the game are immigrants, cowboys, and, rarely, lone miners.



Progress Note:
  As of 8:38 P.M. on 1/6/2020, the basic game mechanisms are down, and the character's abilities are ready to be specialized.
    -A basic 10 x 10 board is drawn, with six characters on each side
    -The characters may not go into other players' squares
    -Each player may choose the identities of their six characters from a pre-game menu, and the common players all have restrictions on
    their movements.
    -When a character is hovered over, a small menu pops up identifying the character, and also having two buttons, which register and report
    interaction but have no features attached to them yet. This feature is toggle-able in-game.

    -Moving forward:
      -DONE -------- For immigrants: when a button is pressed on their pop-up menus, the square in front of the one that they are in will
                     become the foundation of a city.
      -DONE -------- Business Owners and Politicians cannot move
      -DONE -------- Railroads may be built by business owners
      -DONE -------- There will be a city cap of two until a railroad of length three is built.
      -DONE -------- Every turn, a city has the potential of producing another immigrant. This may be done if a cowboy has gone from a railroad to
                     that city without stopping at any other cities since last stopping at a railroad.

ISSUES
  -RESOLVED -------- After rise of Taylorism (maybe?), mines no longer produce immigrants each turn
  -RESOLVED -------- Issues with info-boxes only showing sometimes for #11, #14, and sometimes produced #13s
  -RESOLVED -------- Immigrants produced by mines often cannot build cities
  -RESOLVED -------- Kansas tornado just switches a farmer on one team to the other team
  -RESOLVED -------- J.P. Morgan cannot build Railroads
  -RESOLVED -------- Business owner info-boxes do not always show. Later in game they can stop working, probably after an event? (Kansas tornado?)
  -RESOLVED -------- Sometimes it says occupied squares are occupied when they are not. This has only been observed to occur around farmers generated from Coxey's Rebellion.
  -RESOLVED -------- If an object is on an edge and it has to check all the squares around it an error is thrown. Account for this.
  -PENDING -------- Kansas Tornado generates populists on top of farmers
  -RESOLVED -------- Team 2 mines are not generating immigrants
  -RESOLVED -------- freedmen can move like natives



  -Test if winning system function and if winning is possible/works
  -DONE -------- Change button names for farmers, natives, politicians, etc.
  -DONE -------- Use shapes instead of numbers to label characters in-game
