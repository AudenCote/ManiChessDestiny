  homesteadAct: `

    In 1862, Abraham Lincoln passed the Homestead Act. This permitted settlers moving west in America to buy plots of up to 160 acres of land for a very low price, given that they would commit to occupying that land for at least five years. This drove thousands of prospective farmers west in the 1960s with the hope of being able to set up a profitable farm and raise a family - however, over production of farm products, as well as other factors such as high transportation prices for livestock on railroads, led many farmers to go bankrupt or devastatingly in debt. When the Homestead Act even occurs in Mani-Chess Destiny, two new farmers are added at random on the board. This may seem like a good thing at first, but over production is always a threat, and if your team has more than 3 farmers, then no more cities can be built...

  kansasTornado: `

    Between 1860 and 1900, the number of farmers in the country nearly quadrupled. This led to problems such as overproduction, which put many farmers in poverty. In the late 1880s, a woman named Mary Lease joined the Populist Party and began advocating for the political rights of farmers. She travelled throughout the west and spoke to gatherings of farmers, encouraging them to take action. The slogan of the movement became "raise less corn and more hell," and Lease became known as the "Kansas Tornado" by the way she whipped up the common western farmers into a fury at her speeches. Because of her the populist part grew considerably and farmers began to take action and take their lives into their own hands, when the "Kansas Tornado" event occurs, one farmer from each team is converted into a populist politician.

  panicOf1893: `

    In 1893 there was a massive financial crash that affected every sector of the economy, caused mostly by foreign (Argentinian) crop failure and bank runs as people got wind of financial unstability in the country, worsening the problem. The depression, which lasted from 1893 to 1897 was the worst the country had seen up to that point and caused catastrophic economic losses. As a result of the depression, over 8000 business went bankrupt, 3 million people ended up unemployed, many banks went out of business, and many railroads were forced to liquidate. This devastation is reflected in Mani-Chess Destiny: when the Panic of 1893 event occurs, two railroads are lost at random from the board, one farmer is lost from the board as most western farmers relied heavily on the rail system, and one immigrant is lost as well to represent the unemployment rates skyrocketing.

  `,

  comstockLode: `

    When gold and silver were struck in Washoe, Nevada in 1859, in the Comstock Lode, miners, mostly from California, came flooding into the region. Once the deposits of silver on the surface and in rivers was all taken by individual miners, Eastern business owners came in with more advanced equipment, allowing them to dig deeper than others had before. They were able to extract silver from large veins at a time, and these operations yielded tremendous profits for the first few years - over 300 million dollars in 20 years. For this reason, when the Comstock Lode event occurs in game, another business owner is added at random (in both type and team) to the board.

  `,

  sandCreekMassacre: `

    The Sand Creek Massacre was one of many devastating massacres of Native American communities that took place in the second half of the 19th century. At this particular tragedy, members of the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes were the victims, having had come into conflict with bands of miners moving west. The white settlers promptly built a local army, set to end these conflicts, and the governor of the region called upon local Native groups to gather near military outposts to avoid danger. However, one band of Natives under Black Kettle was attacked anyway by a group of armed miners, many drunk, and 133 Natives were killed. 105 women and children were included in this toll. For this reason, when the Sand Creek Massacre occurs in game, one native is lost from each team.

  `,

  drought: `

    Farmers that moved west faced many different challenges while chasing the agrarian dream, and finding it only to be myth. Besides overproduction and poverty, natural and environmental occurances sometimes devastated everybody's crops. One of these occurances was drought - in the late 1880s, a series of dry spells caused farmers to lose crops and business, and forced them to be creative in how they got water - many set up deep mines with windmills to pump water, and some large coorporations had enough money to set up large irrigation systems. However, windmills often weren't enough for most western farmers, and further losses were had. For this reason, when the drought event occurs in-game, one farmer is lost at random from the board and there is a chance (that decreases as the game continues) that a windmill is built on a random square.


  `,

  mollyMaguires: `

    The Molly Maguires were a secret society started in Ireland that moved to the United States in the late 19th century, and after the Panic of 1873 (less devastating than the similarly named Panic of 1893) began to terrorize coal mines in Pennsylvania, most of which were owned by Franklin B. Gowen, a character in Mani-Chess Destiny who has the ability to build coal mines. The attempts of the Molly Maguires to take down the monopoly that was the coal industry was used against the employees, as the mine owners began to make up offenses that the workers "committed," using them as an excuse to treat the workers more harshly and work them harder. When the Molly Maguires strike in-game, all of the mines on the board disappear (which is not necessarily representative of absolute destruction in real life, but also to counter the power of the mines in-game otherwise) and one immigrant is taken from the board, to represent the oppression directed at the workers after the business owners start making up offenses.

  `,

  timberCultureAct: `

    Following the Homestead Act, the Timber Culture Act was passed in 1873 and granted western farmers another 160 acres (doubling their land) if they planted trees on a quarter of their land. This was done to prevent abuse of the Homestead Act, a timber was needed to build new settlements and for firewood for anyone permanently staying on the given land. It also appealed to farmers and was an attempt to silence some of their grievances as they sunk further into poverty or succumbed to bonanza farms. When the Timber Culture Act event occurs in Mani-Chess Destiny, there is an increasingly low chance as the game goes on that one random square becomes a forest.

  `,

  riseOfTaylorism: `

    Frederick Winslow Taylor developed ideas of how business owners of the gilded age could increase the efficiency of their companies - primarily by subdividing tasks among their employees. This would make workers more interchangeable and "diminish a manager's dependence on any particular employee" and speed up production, as well as decrease need for highly skilled workers. This saved companies money as they could hire less valuable employees, including women and children. As this philosophy caught on, many companies that employed it were more successful, and for this reason when this event occurs in game, one railroad and one mine are added to each side to represent growing strength of business owners.

  `,

  coxeyGetsToWashington: `

    In 1894, Ohio businessman Jacob Coxey led a growing army of unemployed workers and western farmers east towards Washington D.C. to protest the destruction dealt by the Panic of 1893 and promote progressive ideas surrounding work and payment of workers, such as creation of new federal jobs and workers being paid in paper money. Coxey and his army also marched in support of a Populist ideology, in full support of the "People's Party." Although Coxey was promptly arrested upon arrival in D.C., it was a symbol of growing power for the People's Party and the common man, and resulted in further growth of the Populist Party, which advocated mainly for the rights of the people and common fold. Becauseof this, if a team's politician is populist when this event occurs in-game, that team gains two farmers.

  `,

  raggedDick: `

    Ragged Dick was a story first published in 1867 and written by Horatio Alger. Ragged Dick was a teenage bootblack in New York City who grew up in poverty and often homeless. In the story, however, he decides to "turns over a new leaf" and, through luck and hard work, becomes a respectable business owner who commits acts of heroism, such as rescuing a child from drowning, and is therefore rewarded. The message of the story was consistent with the "golden" American dream that appealed to so many immigrants moving to cities and the U.S. - hard work will make them rich, or at least respectable. In real life however, the vast majority of immigrants coming to U.S. cities had a life nothing like that of Ragged Dick - and this golden dream revealed itself to only be gilded. Representative of this draw of immigrants to cities, an immigrant is added to each team when the Publishing of Ragged Dick event occurs in-game.

  `,

  olmsteadAndVaux: `

    Frederick Olmstead and Calvert Vaux were landscape artists and architects in the 19th century who contributed to the idea of America being Gilded by beautifying cities - both to heighten the appeal of cities and to provide a transcendental escape from city life. They did this by planning and seeing to the construction of city parks - most famously, Central Park in New York City. To reflect this, when this event occurs in-game, a "City Park" has the chance of popping up on a random square, but this chance decreases as the game continues.

  `,

  baseball: `

    By the time the Civil War ended in the 1860s, Baseball was growing at an increasing rate in America. Around 200 official clubs had popped up, and by 1869, the Cincinnati Red Stockings (the team that would become the Boston Red Sox) became the first official salaried team. In 1876 Albert Spalding helped to start the National League, and by 1903 the first World Series was taking place. Baseball represents the growing variety of leisurely activites that emerged during the Gilded age at all levels of society. When the baseball event occurs in-game, there is a chance that decreases as the game goes on that a baseball field will be built on a random square.

  `,

  immigrationRestrictionLeague: `

    In 1894 the Immigration Restriction League was created by three prominent educated men who believed that Anglo-Saxons were ethnically superior to many of the different immigrant groups coming to America at that time, especially during the depression after 1893, where wages and employment rates were exceedingly vulnerable. The group attempted to pass a bill in Congress that greatly restricted the number of immigrants able to enter the country and to reduce immigrant rights as well. Because of this, when the Immigration Restriction League event occurs in-game, mines and railroads are not able to produce immigrants in the next turn for either team.

  `,

  pullmanStrike: `

    In late spring to early summer of 1894, railroad workers, led by the American Railway Union and Eugene Debs, went on strike throughout the country against the Pullman Company in what would be come to be known as the Pullman Strike. The Pullman Strike resulted eventually in drastic changes in labor laws in the U.S., and was one of the most significant strikes of the era, and Pullman lost much of its property, mainly in residential holdings. Because of this, when the Pullman Strike event occurs in-game, one railroad is lost at random from the board. However, no immigrants (representing the workers) are added since quite a few striking workers were murdered by railroad managers and other opponents to the strike.

  `,

  reservations: `

    In a significant step of trying to deal with Native populations getting in the way of western expansion and denying the white American's Manifest Destiny, Native Americans were put onto reservations. While these areas were large, they were often far from the tribe's traditional home, and many Native groups, such as the Nez Perce, were moved hundreds of miles from their original homes which were often times situated around sacred spots. This was a further problem for many tribes that relied on buffalo hunting to sustain their families and communities, and they would follow the buffalo as they moved year round. Reservation prevented them from doing this, and as a result many Native groups either suffered great losses of people and culture, or simply left reservation, in which case they had a death warrant automatically placed on their heads. Because of this, when the reservation event is called in-game, Native Americans can no longer move, lasting the rest of the game.

  `,

  dawesAct: `

    In another stage of handling the still sizable Native American population in America, an act was passed called the Dawes Act. This was an action of assimilation, or trying to integrate Natives into American communities and lifestyle. Under the Dawes Act, Native Americans were given a significant portion of land on the Western Frontier, available for cultivation and farming in the future. This further worsened problems among farmers and Natives, as farming in the west was known to be a worthless profession anyway. On top of this, many Natives did not adhere to the ideas that land can be owned, and therefore simply left. That notwithstanding, in-game when the Dawes Act is passed, a native from each side is converted to a farmer - but be careful, this could be problematic. Too many farmers and you could suffer from overproduction!

  `,

  africanAmericanCities: `

    Following the Civil War, there was a significant population of freedmen in both the north and south of the country. As the movement of urbanization began to develope and grow, many of these freedmen as well as more recent African-American immigrants began to flood into cities (primarily Chicago, New York, Washington, and Baltimore) in tens of thousands as there was little other place for them to be successful in the country, and cheap housing could often be found in places such as tenements. In reflection of this, when this event occurs in-game, if a team has more than two freedmen on their side, another city is added to their side.

  `,

  bessemerProcess: `

    In the late 1800s, Henry Bessemer (along with William Kelly) developed a new method for creating steel from iron. This involved blowing air through melted iron to bubble out impurities or slag, and took the name of the "Bessemer Process." This new techniques, along with others developed slightly later in the time period, allowed for immensely greater production of steel, a necessary resource for the building of railroads, as well as the steel girders discussed in another event. Because of this, when the Bessemer Process is developed in Mani-Chess Destiny, one railroad is added to the board at random to represent these new mechanical achievements during this time period.

  `,

  haymarketSquare: `

    In 1886 in Chicago, the American Federation of Labor and workers from other companies were going on strike, and called a meeting between the radical leaders of the union movement and the enraged workers at Haymarket Square. Some way into the growing protests as other strikers joined, police ordered the rabble to diffuse - but they did not, and instead a bomb was thrown in their direction by a protestor. It killed 7 officers and injured nearly 70 others. The police fired on the crowd, and even more people were killed, and later more would be tried for murder and hung or put in prison. The Haymarket Square riot became a symbol of the growing movement of anarchy in the country, as well as a symbol for the push for worker's rights and the creation of unions, and still remains so today. However, since it was a direct loss to workers on that day, one immigrant is lost from the board when the Haymarket Square event is called in-game.

  `,

  steelGirderStructure: `

    With the development of revolutionary new technologies, from mass production in making tools and machinery to the Bessemer Process in creating steel, as well as the spur of building collapses and city-wide fires losing business owners' money and destroying the homes of immigrants and others, came new architectural techniques as well. The development of the steel girder structure greatly strengthened buildings and eventually allowed for the building of skyscrapers - in cases like Manhattan where a city may not be able to spread out, there is still room to spread up. When the Steel Girder Structure event occurs in Mani-Chess Destiny, City Fire events no longer have any effect.


  `,

  cityFire: `

    With the immense growth of cities and the populations within them, whole neighborhoods had to spring up practically overnight to compensate. This spurred a careless attitude towards the building of new cities throughout the country among business owners, and soon had devastating effects. Entire floors or even buildings were known to collapse, especially in overcrowded and cheaply built tenements, and in some cases great fires ran rampant and destroyed whole areas of cities. Examples of this are the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, which left over 100,000 homeless, and the Boston Fire of 1872. When fires strike in Mani-Chess Destiny, if the Steel Girder Structure has not been developed yet, one city is eliminated at random from the board.

  `,

  lookingBackward: `

    In 1888, the utopian novel Looking Backward by Edward Bellamy, from Chicopee, Massachusetts, was published. It was one of the greatest bestsellers of its time, and told the story of a young man who falls into a coma and wakes up in the year 2000 in the United States, now a socialist utopia. The book addresses problems with capitalism, and talks about how with this new concept of socialism, which Bellamy calls nationalism, the great cities of the U.S. could be greater, as seen by the young man in his book. This spurred a new movement among intellectuals in the U.S., and lead to further support for unions and the Knights of Labor. Symbolizing what is depicted in the book, a new city is added at random to the board.

  `,

  socialDarwinism: `

    After the publishing of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859, the idea of evolution became progressively more appealing to higher members of society such as business owners, possibly as an explanation for their level of social status over others, such as their workers. When some applied this newfound idea of survival of the fittest to society, social Darwinism was born, and was used as a reason by some factory and business owners to further use or abuse their employees for the company's benefit. Because of this, when Social Darwinism arises in-game, one immigrant, representing a lowly worker, is lost at random from the board.

  `,

  commerceAct: `

    As the railroad industry grew early on, it did so unchecked by the government, and was therefore able to abuse the impoverished or nearly so farmers out of their money each time a ride to a city was needed. With the rise of the populist party and support for the common man, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 was passed. This bill attempted to diffuse power from the monopoly that was the railroad industry (most notably under Vanderbilt) by enforcing certain regulations on it, such as requiring railroads to post their fees publicly so that they could not be raised on the whim of the railroad managers and at the expense of the poor. To reflect this, when the ICA is passed in Mani-Chess Destiny, if a team has more than two railroads a farmer is added to that team, to represent the farmers being better able to utilize the railroads in their own good.

  `,

  currencyAct: `

    One of the main building blocks that the Populist Party platform was built upon by the time of their demise in the 1890s was that of a 16:1 ratio of silver to gold value in the American economy. This would push inflation, resulting in the debts of farmers to be more easily paid off, an idea that was appealing to many of the supporters of the People's Party, and the people themselves. However, having made a poor decision that led to the vote being split in the 1896 election, the Populist Party began to fade, and with it, their plans for the national currency. In 1900, the Currency or Gold Standard Act was passed, making gold the official American standard. This contributed to marking the end for the Populist Party, and so when the Currency Act is passed in-game, one populist politician is gone at random from the board.
