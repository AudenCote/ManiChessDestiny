# ManiChessDestiny
Mani-Chess Destiny is a JavaScript based computer game built off of chess, but in the style of the gilded age. Choose for your team of six from a selection of era-appropriate characters, including but not limited to J.P. Morgan, Frederick Remington, assorted immigrants, cowboys, and native Americans, and more.
